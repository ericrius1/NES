NOTES

Publish a list of games, have players subscribe to them

Just have one lobby, but once 5 people join, automatically send them off to a game
Otherwise let at least two people start whenever they want

Show alert tab when another player has joined and the game has started!




What is best way to show lobby timer if it is just a global variable? Should we put in in a collection or do it some other way?

Also how to keep track of it- right now seems janky if I stress test lots of players joining at once.



Might need to put in collection
