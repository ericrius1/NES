          <h3> How to play:</h2>
          <p> 1. Each story is composed of multiple rounds</p>
          <p>   2. Each round has two parts. In the first part, you and your co-authors write your addition to the narrative in-progress. Keep an eye on the old-timey timer on the upper right hand side of the screen- when the second-hand reaches 12 o clock, you are out of time!</p>
          <p>3. The second stage of the round is the voting stage. Tab through all of your co-authors submissions and vote on the one you think is the best addition to the unfolding narrative.</p>
          <p>   4. After everyone votes, the submission with the most votes will be incorporated into the story! </p>
          <p> 5. Now a new round starts, with everyone writing a new submission based in continuation of the previous round's winning submisison. </p>
          <p> 6. When a game first begins, you may see a prompt at the top of the page. You are meant to continue the story based on this prompt. So, for example, if you see "It was a dark and stormy night..." you could write "and the rain fell in torrents..." for your submission. If you don't see a prompt, write anything at all to start the story off!
